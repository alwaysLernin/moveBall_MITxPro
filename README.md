## **Description**

This is an assignment from the MITxPro Coding Bootcamp that introduces object creation and manipulation.

# **Usage**

Initially this was used to practice object manipulation (attributes, movement, and direction change) in preparation for later assignments. After completion of that section of the training, I have used it for testing and experimentation.

# **What I Learned**

+ Object creation
+ Looping
+ Variable initialization, modification, and retrieval
+ Introduction to DOM objects (document)

# **What Frustrate Me** 

+ I couldn't figure out how to programmatically create multipe copies of Objects
  + Fortunately the following weeks lessons covered this!
+ Realizing the next week how close I was to figuring out how to create multiple copies! :)

# **Roadmap**

I've found a YouTube site that presents advanced animation techniques through a series of simple and easy to follow videos. I have started a new repo where I am first building the projects alongside the presenter, reviewing and researching the new concepts that he introduces and then experiment with tweaks and modifications of the code.
