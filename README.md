# **Description**

This is an assignment from the MITxPro Coding Bootcamp that introduces object creation and manipulation. Not all of this code was written by me. The instructors provided some of the initial code in order to have us focus on the new concepts introduced in this section.

# **Usage**

Initially this was used to practice object manipulation (attributes, movement, and direction change) in preparation for later assignments. After completion of that section of the training, I have used it for testing and experimentation.

# **What I Learned**

+ Object creation
+ Looping
+ Variable initialization, modification, and retrieval
+ Introduction to DOM objects (document)

# **What Frustrated Me** 

+ I couldn't figure out how to programmatically create multipe copies of Objects
  + Fortunately the following weeks lessons covered this!
+ Realizing the next week how close I was to figuring out how to create multiple copies! :)

# **Roadmap**

I've found a YouTube site that presents advanced animation techniques through a series of simple and easy to follow videos. I have started a new repo where I am first building the projects alongside the presenter, reviewing and researching the new concepts that he introduces and then experimenting with tweaks and modifications of the code.
